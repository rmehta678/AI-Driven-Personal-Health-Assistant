Project Title: HealthChat - AI-driven Personal Health Assistant
Overview:

Goal: Develop and deploy advanced generative AI solutions for fitness/health, integrating all required technologies and skills.
*  Project 5: Transformer-Based Health Advisor with MLOps and RAG Integration
	*  Objective: Build a transformer-based virtual health advisor generating personalized workout/nutrition plans, enhanced with RAG pipelines and MLOps, deployed on NVIDIA infrastructure.
	*  Dataset: Custom fitness/health logs (e.g., heart rate, diet) from Kaggle or synthetic data (~10,000 records).
	*  Steps:
	  	*  Generative AI/LLM Architectures: Code a transformer (self-attention, positional encoding) in PyTorch, fine-tune with LoRA for efficiency, and validate with QLoRA/DoRA for low-resource settings. Target BLEU > 0.7.
		*  RAG Pipelines: Integrate LangChain to fetch real-time health articles, LangGraph for dynamic plan adjustments, and Haystack for semantic search, creating a sophisticated retrieval-augmented framework.
		*  MLOps Principles: Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions for model updates, automate training pipelines with Kubeflow, and implement production monitoring (e.g., Prometheus) on NVIDIA GPUs.
		*  NVIDIA Technologies: Optimize with CUDA, TensorRT, and cuDNN; containerize with NGC.
		*  Agentic AI Standards: Explore MCP protocol for multi-agent orchestration (e.g., diet vs. exercise agents), ensuring interoperability.
		*  Software Engineering: Develop a Python/Flask API, use C++ for performance-critical inference.
		*  Foundational Expertise/Education: Document the process as a tutorial (e.g., GitHub README) reflecting MS-level rigor, targeting AI/cloud learners.
		*  Communication/Collaboration: Simulate a client pitch deck, collaborate with a peer (e.g., via GitHub issues) for feedback.
		*  Passion for Trends: Incorporate emerging tools (e.g., latest PEFT advancements) based on real-time X/web searches.
		*  Deliverable: A demo app with RAG-enhanced plans, MLOps dashboard, and educational guide.
	*  Takeaway: Master GenAI, RAG, MLOps, and client-facing skills in a health context.
